%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Function symmetric5x5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:  
%      Compute a 5Ã—5 symmetric nearest-neighbor mean filter at each pixel 
%      in an image 
%
% Input Variables:
%      I       MxN input 2D gray-scale image to be filtered
%
% Returned Results:
%      res     new image cantaining the filtered results
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Get the size of input image and apply zero padding
%      2.  For each valid pixel, select the most similar point for each 
%      pair of points symmetrically opposite each other
%      3.  Average together selected points and assign to xk,l
%
% Restrictions/Notes:
%      None 
%
% The following functions are called:
%      zero.m       generate image full of zeros
